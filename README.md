---------------------------------------
## Requirements
SiriDB Admin only works with SiriDB version 2.0.16 and higher. For older versions of SiriDB the manage tool is required and can be found at https://github.com/SiriDB/siridb-manage

## Installation
SiriDB Admin Tool can be compiled from source or, for most systems, you can simply download a pre-compiled binary.

### Pre-compiled
Go to https://github.com/SiriDB/siridb-admin/releases/latest and download the binary for your system.
In this documentation we refer to the binary as `siridb-admin`. On Linux/OSX it might be required to set the execution flag:
```
$ chmod +x siridb-admin_X.Y.Z_OS_ARCH.bin
```

You might want to copy the binary to /usr/local/bin and create a symlink like this:
```
$ sudo cp siridb-admin_X.Y.Z_OS_ARCH.bin /usr/local/bin/
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/siridb-admin_X.Y.Z_OS_ARCH.bin /usr/local/bin/siridb-admin
```
Note: replace `X.Y.Z_OS_ARCH` with your binary, for example `1.1.1_linux_amd64`

### Compile from source
> Before compiling from source make sure **go**, **npm** and **git** are installed and your [$GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) is set.

Clone the project using git. (we assume git is installed)
```
git clone https://github.com/SiriDB/siridb-admin
```

Make sure less is installed:
```
$ sudo npm install -g less less-plugin-clean-css
```

The gobuild.py script can be used to build the binary:
```
$ ./gobuild.py -i -l -w -b -p
```

Or, if you want the development version which uses original files from /build and /static instead of build-in files:
```
$ ./gobuild.py -i -l -w -b -d
```

## Graphical Web Interface
A web interface can be started with the following command:
```
siridb-admin --http
```
This will start a webserver listening on port 8080. You can now access the graphical interface by opening url http://localhost:8080 in your favorite web-browser.

Note: you might want to use a different port for the webserver. This can be done using the `-O` or `--port` argument flag. For example:
```
siridb-admin --http --port 5050
```

## Command-line arguments
SiriDB Admin can be used by just using command line arguments. This can be useful in case you want to create and extend a SiriDB database using a script.

All commands start with the following arguments:
```
siridb-admin -u <service_account> [-p <password>] [-s <siridb_server>] <command> ...
```
The service account is a required argument. By default the `sa` user with password `siri` is installed on a SiriDB server and this account will be used in most examples in this documentation.

If the `-p` flag with the service account password is not given, the tool will ask for the service account password.

The other optional argument flag `-s` can be used to provide a SiriDB server address and optional port. If not given then the default `localhost:9000` is used. If we, for example, have installed SiriDB on a server with hostname `siridb01.foo.local`, we can simply use argument `-s siridb01.foo.local`. Note that adding `:9000` is not required since port 9000 is the default port.

It is also possible to use an IPv4 or IPv6 address instead of a hostname. In case you want to use both an IPv6 address and use an alternative port then do not forget to put the IPv6 address between braces. For example: `[::1]:5050` is a valid IPv6 address and port.

If something goes wrong you should usually get an error message with some information. More information can be printed when the `--verbose` flag is used. The `--verbose` flag works together with all arguments including the `--http` argument.

### Service accounts
Service accounts are used for managing databases. A service account is a user on a SiriDB server that never has access to a SiriDB database. We call users with access to a database 'database users'. We keep these accounts seperate because database accounts exist in a database which possible extends over multiple SiriDB servers.

### List service accounts
Get all service accounts on siridb01.foo.local using service account sa with password siri:
```
siridb-admin -u sa -p siri -s siridb01.foo.local get-accounts
```

#### New service account
A new service account can be created using the command below.
```
siridb-admin -u sa -s siridb01.foo.local new-account bob passwd4bob
```
This command will ask for the `sa` password and then create a service account `bob` with password `passwd4bob` on a SiriDB server with hostname `siridb01.foo.local`.

#### Change password
A password can be changed using the following command:
```
siridb-admin -u sa -p siri -s siridb01.foo.local:9000 change-password newpassw0rd
```
This will change the password for the `sa` service account on SiriDB server `siridb01.foo.local` from `siri` to `newpassw0rd`.

#### Remove service account
Service accounts can be removed using the following command:
```
siridb-admin -u sa -p siri -s siridb01.foo.local drop-account bob
```
This command will remove service account `bob` from SiriDB server `siridb01.foo.local`.

### Databases
SiriDB Admin can be used to create a new database or extend an existing database with a new pool or replica. Note that databases can not be removed with this tool. As long as a database exists only on one SiriDB server you can remove the database by stopping the siridb-server process and then remove the database directory. All database directories can be found in the database path which can be configured in the siridb configuration file.

### List databases
Get all existing databases on a SiriDB server siridb01.foo.local using service account sa with password siri:
```
siridb-admin -u sa -p siri -s siridb01.foo.local get-databases
```

### New database
A new database can be created with the following syntax:
```
siridb-admin -u <service_account> [flags] new-database
  -d, --db-name=DB-NAME        Database name. (Must be at least 2 and at most 20 characters. First
                               character must be a letter. Last character must be a letter or number.
                               In between letters, numbers, hyphen and underscores are allowed)
  -t, --time-precision="ms"    Time precision for the new database. Supported time precissions are
                               s (second), ms (millisecond), us (microsecond) and ns (nanosecond).
                               This value cannot be changed once the database is created.
  -b, --buffer-size=1024       Buffer size for the new database. Each series uses a buffer space in
                               both memory and disk before points are actually written to shards.
                               This value cannot be changed once the database is created.
  -N, --duration-num="1w"      Number duration for the new database. Points are written to shards and
                               each shard has points for a specific time range. The size or time
                               window can be chosen but not changed once the database is created. For
                               example: the value '1w' will create shards holding points for 1 week.
  -L, --duration-log="1d"      Log duration for the new database. Like numeric duration but then for
                               log values. At the moment log values are not supported by SiriDB but
                               this will be implemented in a future release.

```
For example:
```
siridb-admin -u sa -p siri -s siridb01.foo.local new-database -d dbexample -t s
```
This will create database `dbexample` on SiriDB server `siridb01.foo.local` with a *second* time precision.

>Note: each new database will be created with a default database user `iris` and password `siri`.

### New replica
The following syntax can be used to create a new replica:
```
siridb-admin -u <service_account> [flags] new-replica
  -d, --db-name=DB-NAME          Database name where you want to add the new replica to.
  -U, --db-user=DB-USER          User with full privileges to the database.
  -P, --db-password=DB-PASSWORD  Password for the database user.
  -S, --db-server=DB-SERVER      SiriDB server address[:port]. Can be any server from the database
                                 you want to add a new replica to.
  -o, --pool=POOL                Pool number which you want to create the replica for.
  -f, --force                    Suppress warning message.
```
For example:
```
siridb-admin -u sa -p siri -s siridb02.foo.local new-replica -d dbexample -U iris -P siri -S siridb01.foo.local --pool 0
```
This will ask for confirmation and then create a replica on SiriDB server `siridb02.foo.local` for pool `0` in database `dbexample`.

### New pool
The following syntax can be used to create a new pool:
```
siridb-admin -u <service_account> [flags] new-pool
  -d, --db-name=DB-NAME          Database name where you want to add the new pool to.
  -U, --db-user=DB-USER          User with full privileges to the database.
  -P, --db-password=DB-PASSWORD  Password for the database user.
  -S, --db-server=DB-SERVER      SiriDB server address[:port]. Can be any server from the database
                                 you want to add a new pool to.
  -f, --force                    Suppress warning message.
```
For example:
```
siridb-admin -u sa -p siri -s siridb03.foo.local new-pool -d dbexample -U iris -P siri -S siridb01.foo.local
```
This will ask for confirmation and then create a new pool on SiriDB server `siridb03.foo.local` for database `dbexample`. Pool id's will be incremented automatically so if the database only had pool `0` then the new pool will have id `1`.

This will ask for confirmation and then create a replica on SiriDB server `siridb02.foo.local` for pool `0` in database `dbexample`.

### Drop database
>Note: requires at least SiriDB version 2.0.31
The following syntax can be used to drop a database:
```
siridb-admin -u <service_account> [flags] drop-database
  -d, --db-name=DB-NAME          Database name where you want to add the new pool to.
  -i, --ignore-offline           Usually the database will be removed from all servers in the cluster and therefore an error is returned in case one or more servers are offline. This flag can be used to ignore offline servers.
  -f, --force                    Suppress warning message.
```
For example:
```
siridb-admin -u sa -p siri -s siridb01.foo.local drop-database -d dbexample
```
This will ask for confirmation and then remove the database from all servers.
